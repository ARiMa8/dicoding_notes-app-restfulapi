üìù Dicoding Notes App: RESTful API Integration

This application is a final project developed for the "Fundamental Front-End Web Development" course at Dicoding Academy. It provides a functional and responsive notes-taking solution, designed to demonstrate a solid grasp of modern web development concepts.

‚ú® Key Features
- Full RESTful API Integration: The app interacts with a public API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. All notes are persisted on a remote server.
- Web Component Architecture: The user interface (UI) is built with reusable Web Components, ensuring the code is structured, modular, and easy to maintain.
- Responsive Layout: The design utilizes CSS Grid to display notes dynamically across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- Loading Indicators & Feedback: Users receive clear visual feedback through a loading indicator when data is being fetched from the API, along with SweetAlert2 notifications for successful or failed operations.
- Smooth Animations: Transition effects and animations powered by Anime.js create a more engaging and dynamic user experience.
- Modern JavaScript & Module Bundling: The project uses ESM (ECMAScript Modules), which are managed and bundled by Webpack to optimize code and assets.
